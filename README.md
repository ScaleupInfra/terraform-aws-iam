# Code Explanation: IAM User Setup
This code is used to set up user accounts and permissions for a system. Let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Creating a Group

First, we create a group called "autoscaleupinfra". A group is a collection of users with similar access needs. You all will be part of this group.

### Step 2: Listing Users

Next, we have a list of users who will have access to the system. We have ten users in total, each with their own names or email addresses.

### Step 3: Creating Users

Now, we create user accounts for each of you based on the names or email addresses provided. You will have your own individual accounts to log in.

### Step 4: Setting User Login Profiles

To enable you to log in to your accounts, we set up login profiles and generate passwords for each user. You don't have to worry about changing the passwords for now.

### Step 5: Creating an EC2 Role

We create a special role called "ec2-role". This role defines what you can do within the system and what actions you're allowed to perform.

### Step 6: Defining EC2 Policies

Two policies are defined: one for creating EC2 instances and another for creating ECR repositories. Policies are like rules that determine what you can do.

### Step 7: Attaching Policies to the EC2 Role

We attach the EC2 and ECR policies to the "ec2-role". This ensures that you, as users with this role, can follow the defined rules and perform the necessary actions.

### Step 8: Granting Full Access to Users

Good news! Each one of you is granted full access to EC2. We attach a policy called "AmazonEC2FullAccess" to your user accounts, allowing you to perform all EC2-related actions.

### Step 9: Granting Full Access to the Group

Since you are all part of the "autoscaleupinfra" group, we also grant the entire group full access to EC2. This means any user within the group can perform EC2 actions without restrictions.

### Step 10: Creating a File with User Passwords

For your convenience, we create a file called "iam_user_passwords.txt". It contains your usernames and passwords, serving as a reference for you to remember your login credentials.

### Step 11: Outputting User Passwords

Lastly, we provide an output that displays your usernames and passwords. This output helps you quickly find and access your login credentials whenever needed.

## That's it! This code sets up your user accounts, defines permissions, and ensures you have the necessary access to work within the system.
